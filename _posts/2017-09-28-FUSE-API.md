Looks like a call to a operation not defined in the `struct fuse_operations`
will result in a "Function not implemented" (`ENOSYS`) error. (Will test it later)

All methods are optional, but some are essential for a useful filesystem (e.g.
getattr). Open, flush, release, fsync, opendir, releasedir, fsyncdir,
access, create, truncate, lock, init and destroy are special purpose
methods, without which a full featured filesystem can still be implemented.
